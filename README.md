### Conky script to show Dialog Broadband usage

This is my initial version and it's really really buggy and needs quite a lot of work to get it user ready. But the good news is, it works, at least for me for now.

Make sure you have casperjs installed and update getBB.js file with your own username and password :( (yeah, I know it sucks, that's why it needs a better way)
